        <h2>Mark I</h2>
        <p>The first armor that the MCU's heroic Tony Stark builds is a matter of life and death. Instead of building a
            missile for the Ten Rings inside a cave in the middle of the desert, Tony and fellow hostage Ho Yinsen
            (Shaun
            Tob) secretly put together a rough suit of armor with the few resources they can salvage. They arm it with
            two
            flamethrowers under each hand, a limited rocket launcher, and very crude jet boots. Given the source of its
            materials, the whole armor is bulletproof, although its rushed design leaves multiple vulnerable spots at
            risk,
            such as the joints and eye holes. As unrefined as it was, it served to inspire Tony to become the invincible
            Iron Man. An alternate-universe version of the Mark I armor appears in What If...?, which reveals that
            Tony's
            father, Howard, creates it for Steve Rogers once Peggy Carter takes the Super Soldier serum. Lorem ipsum

        <h2>Mark II</h2>
        <p>After surviving Afghanistan, Tony Stark returns with an ambitious goal in mind. He commits himself to build
            an
            improved version of the armor he created, in the words of Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), "with a box of
            scraps."
            Tony first develops advanced repulsor technology and then devises the now-famous armor design. Sleek and
            aerodynamic, the Mark II is the first suit to integrate JARVIS (Paul Bettany) and a fully-functioning HUD,
            apart
            from the hundreds of carefully arranged moving parts that grant Tony maneuverability while flying. Its major
            weakness is its inability to reach high altitudes without freezing, a flaw that Tony later uses to defeat
            Stane.
            This armor is the first one used by James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) preceding the official debut of War Machine,
            who
            now has his own Disney+ show centered on Iron Man armors, Armor Wars. Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet

        <h2>Mark III</h2>
        <p>Tony Stark's Mark III armor symbolizes the consolidation of Iron Man as a full-fledged superhero. The most
            evident change he implements in this model is the iconic red-and-gold scheme, inspired by one of his many
            luxury
            cars. This is also the first armor fully designed to hold up in battle, incorporating a whole arsenal of
            anti-tank missiles, flares, and shoulder-mounted miniguns, besides the intensified repulsors and a stronger
            uni-beam that comes from Stark's arc reactor. Its gold titanium alloy fixes the icing problem and enhances
            its
            strength as well as its durability. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Minus, facilis
