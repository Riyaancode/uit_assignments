            <h2>Testimonials</h2>
            <p>&quot;The JenWARE onesies were the hit of the baby shower. The custom letter &quot;a&quot; and handmade
                quality made this gift really stand out among the cookie-cutter clothes from the department store.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Thanks for the cool JenWARE barware. I couldn't wait until I found &quot;Mr. Right,&quot; so I just
                bought a set for myself! My friends always want to know where I got them so I send them to your
                site.&quot; </p>
